# ece-communications-textbook-figures

Many figures for the textbook (and possibly all, eventually) are made up in TikZ (LaTeX package) on Overleaf. In many cases it is easier to generate the data in Python first then plot it with TikZ. As well, I believe it's educational to poke around the code used the generate the figures so I'm making this publically available. If you find errors feel free to issue a PR! If you have questions - I would prefer you contact me through the class channels (Slack, email, in person, etc) rather than on here as a Github Issue.

Cheers,

Nick
